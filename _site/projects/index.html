            <h3>Stir Analytics for Business</h3>
        
            <p>Started in Fall 2015, Stir Analytics for Business is a data visualization tool for management to understand the benefits of the Stir Kinetic Desk as well as empower decision making. Built on Django framework, Stir Analytics for Business uses data visualization in order to maximize efficiency and gain insight to the workspace.</p> 
            <p>You can read about the Stir Kinetic Desk as well as Stir Analytics for Business <u><a href="http://rft-llc.com/the-new-stir-kinetic-desk-m1-and-stir-analytics-for-business/">here</a></u> or <u><a href="http://fmlink.com/articles/neocon-2015-stir-slims-down-its-smart-kinetic-desk-adds-company-wide-analytics-platform/">here</a></u></p>

            <h3>Smart Cells</h3>
                <p>Built primarily in python, Smart Cell is a platform that uses past data to predict the future of consumption of data on a given cell tower.</p>
                <p>Targeted at carriers and companies that own cell towers, we developed a platform that uses data usage as a metric in a Kalman Filter, which produces a vector of predicted data which can be compared to the actual data. This sort of machine learning application could be applied to real time data and predict large influxes of data, phone and text usage onto cell towers causing drops in coverage as well as allow cell tower developers to prioritize the the building cell towers in optimal locations. </p>
                <p>I and a small team developed this machine learning application with sponsored data from M2 App Insight as an entrant and winner of the <u><a href= "http://devpost.com/software/datathon2016">2016 UCI Data Science Hackathon Machine Learning category</a></u>.  </p>

            <h3>Focusly</h3>
              <p>Built using Express, React and Redux, Focusly is a material designed inspired productivity timer powered by Spotify that uses work and rest intervals backed by Users' playlists.</p>
              <p>A User chooses two different playlists and the number of sessions, and then a timer begins and the User's work playlist is played through the browser. When the time ends, the user is notified by a change of playlists with a subtle alarm.</p>  
              <p>You can access the currently in Beta application at <u><a href="http://focusly.us/">http://focusly.us/</a></u> and requires a Spotify Premium Account. The github repo can be accessed <u><a href="https://github.com/trizzle21/Focusly"><u>here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Personal Website</h3>
        <p>Hosted on GitHub Pages, this personal site is built as light as possible. Everything is barebones and handtailored to the site itself. The site and blog is generated by Jekyll.</p>
        <p>Since there is no backend, I use external sources (APIs, CDNs and iFrames) to handle any functionality that normally would be handled by a server. Currently there is no need, but the eventual goal is to have enough functionality to warrant a backend, built on either ruby, python or javascript. The site has also been entirely optimized for mobile so it's accessible by all devices. </p>
