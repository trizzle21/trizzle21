                <p><p>I finally did it! I made the move from Southern California to New York!</p>

<p>It was not an easy process but oh did I learn so much along the way.</p>

<p>The first step was to spend a week in an airbnb while I got used to the climate, found an apartment, and get to work. My very first night, I had to wait an hour and a half for my airbnb host to let me in. The weather in early March was absolutely freezing, so my first experience as a future resident of New York was absolutely terrible. My hands have had frostbite before (it gets very very very cold at 6am in the valley cycling path near my parent’s house). So I got the wonderful residual numbness come back. After a very grumpy amount of texting I got into the airbnb, which I’m pretty sure now the whole airbnb was illegal. Airbnb has a tricky relationship with New York and most (all) the apartments I viewed wrote in eviction clauses for airbnb hosting.</p>

                <p><p>It’s 3 months in and I’ve finally released Focusly! Focusly is a online tabata timer that integrates with Spotify that I vowed to finish in ~3 months in my New Years resolution. This post is going to be an update on that as well as introduction to my new project.</p>

<p>Focusly is not an overly sophisticated tool built on node.js (express.js), redux, redux router, react sound and react. Express.js handles the oAuth2 authentication tokens as the middle man between the client and the user while Redux  and React handle the client side state and views. The way it works is that the user chooses the number of cycles and two playlists for both their work and rest sessions. The user than is guided to page which utilizes a timer and a Spotify play button in the sidebar. When the timer ends, a subtle alarm is sounded and the user is prompted to start change playlists.</p>

                <p><p>It’s 2017! Guess it’s time to make some resolutions some of which I’ll never accomplish like all good New Years Resolutioners. However, one resolution I think I totally can resolve is spending an hour a day on personal projects. I think an hour a day (at least) is an excellent way to get my other resolution is to finish and ship all my personal projects.</p>

<p>The first project I’d like to finish is my online tabata timer that integrates with Spotify. I’m making use of material design and react.js to make a beautiful UI/UX that lets users play music along with their work projects without having an annoying beeper remind you to rest. Instead, a change of music moves you to the next session. Ok so I lied a little bit, I won’t be working for a whole hour a day, rather two 25 minute periods with two 5 minute breaks. Still as long as I get the work done and I don’t get distracted I’ll call it a W. I want to finish it in 3 months.</p>

            <span class="date">September 19, 2016</span>

                <p><p>I feel like it’s kind of corny to make my first blog post a review of the technology I’m using to make said blog but I don’t really care. The first think I like about Jeykll is how easy it is to set up. I will say however, I already had the developer environment set up so all I had to do set up a git repo and type in the command</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">bundle</span> <span class="nb">exec</span> <span class="n">jekyll</span> <span class="kp">new</span> <span class="p">.</span> <span class="nf">-</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">force</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>and I was off to the races. Note, this may be hard if you’ve never used gem or another package manager. Furthermore, everything is already cleanly packaged with sass from the get go and comes with everything you need to build a site in literally seconds. I love the fact that I can prototype my site in another branch, test it with one command,</p>
