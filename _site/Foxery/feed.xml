    <title>Foxery</title>
    <description>Foxery is a peer to peer health sharing application that allows users to focus on exercise, nutrition, and wellness. It encourages users to share what they do to be healthy, while also learning what other  people are doing to optimize their health and performance metrics. We believe that gathering insights from  friends, coaches, influencers, athletes and other health enthusiasts, will promote a continuous search for each  individuals best approach to living a healthy life. Sharing expertise and insights from ones own health practices  generates a comfortable setting to share everything one does to be healthy.
