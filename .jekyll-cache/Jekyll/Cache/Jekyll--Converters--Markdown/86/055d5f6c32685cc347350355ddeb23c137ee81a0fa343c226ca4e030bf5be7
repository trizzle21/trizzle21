I"r<p>It’s 2017! Guess it’s time to make some resolutions some of which I’ll never accomplish like all good New Years Resolutioners. However, one resolution I think I totally can resolve is spending an hour a day on personal projects. I think an hour a day (at least) is an excellent way to get my other resolution is to finish and ship all my personal projects.</p>
