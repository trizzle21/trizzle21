<p>I finally did it! I made the move from Southern California to New York!</p>

<p>It was not an easy process but oh did I learn so much along the way.</p>

<p>The first step was to spend a week in an airbnb while I got used to the climate, found an apartment, and get to work. My very first night, I had to wait an hour and a half for my airbnb host to let me in. The weather in early March was absolutely freezing, so my first experience as a future resident of New York was absolutely terrible. My hands have had frostbite before (it gets very very very cold at 6am in the valley cycling path near my parentâ€™s house). So I got the wonderful residual numbness come back. After a very grumpy amount of texting I got into the airbnb, which Iâ€™m pretty sure now the whole airbnb was illegal. Airbnb has a tricky relationship with New York and most (all) the apartments I viewed wrote in eviction clauses for airbnb hosting.</p>

<p>Due to my works wonderful flexible hours I was able to disappear frequently to take looks at apartments so that was nice. I found borrowing a citi bike card was a life saver as I was able to get from apartment showing to apartment showing without much hassel besides occassionally stopping to check google maps. Thinking Brooklyn would be cheaper, I initally started my search there, but I ended my search in Manhattan in the East Village in a small studio!</p>

<p>Moving to New York was quite another experience. Thanks to my mom (whoâ€™s probably the only one reading this), moving went very smooth. I brought no furniture with me and instead put together a nice little apartment with ikea furniture. Due to time constraints, I spent a little extra money on having ikea furniture built for me. It freed up my mom and Iâ€™s time to work on the apartment, eat, and not be pissed off the whole time.</p>

<p>I started work as software engineer at Noodle Pros (<a href="https://noodlepros.com">noodlepros.com</a>), a tutoring company located in Union Square. My main responsibilities are bringing their system to life and adding new and better features to help with some aggressive growth goals. I love that Iâ€™m reinventing tutoring and building engaging tools that our users (clients and tutors) will use daily.</p>

<p>I have totally lost the time to keep up with a commit a day. I will try as hard as I can to continue it now, whether it be even css changes (Iâ€™m trying to learn design) or actual coding, but itâ€™s hard when I have the pressure to build new features with aggressive deadlines at work. I assure you have kept up with commits, just not on my public commit log. I have so many new adventures a head of me and Iâ€™ll try to keep them here.</p>
